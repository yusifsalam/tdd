# [TDD MOOC](https://tdd.mooc.fi): Tetris

In this exercise you will be implementing a Tetris game using Test-Driven Development (TDD). The first couple dozen
tests have already been written for you - just uncomment them one by one. This should help to get over the initial
hurdle of knowing what tests to write when getting started with TDD. After that the training wheels are removed, and
it's time to write your own tests in the latter part of this exercise.

The instructions on what to do are in the [docs directory](docs/). This exercise is split into 10 "levels" which you
should implement in order. They represent a realistic TDD approach of adding features incrementally.

This exercise uses [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) (ES6/ECMAScript 2015),
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)
assertions, but the concepts are language agnostic. It would be quite easy to translate the example tests to another
programming language as you go. There also exists an
older [Java-based predecessor](https://github.com/luontola/tdd-tetris-tutorial) of this exercise.

Refer to [the course material](https://tdd.mooc.fi) to learn more about TDD.
