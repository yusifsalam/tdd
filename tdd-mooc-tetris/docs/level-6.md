# Level 6: Rotating falling tetrominoes

> Let's keep adding player controls: rotations.

You're now responsible for covering all the corner cases. Here are the features to be implemented:

- a falling tetromino can be rotated
- it cannot be rotated when there is no room to rotate
- [wall kick](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Wall_kick): when it is up against a wall and is rotated, but there is no
  room to rotate, move it away from the wall if possible
