It's time to write your own tests. Here are some example test names, which should be enough to cover all the corner
cases:

- a falling tetromino can be moved left
- a falling tetromino can be moved right
- a falling tetromino can be moved down
- it cannot be moved left beyond the board
- it cannot be moved right beyond the board
- it cannot be moved down beyond the board (will stop falling)
- it cannot be moved left through other blocks
- it cannot be moved right through other blocks
- it cannot be moved down through other blocks (will stop falling)
