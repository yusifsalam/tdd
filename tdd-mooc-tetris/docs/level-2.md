# Level 2: Rotating shapes

Open the [test/RotatingShapes.test.mjs](../test/RotatingShapes.test.mjs) file and implement its tests one by one.

The `RotatingShape` class is meant to be [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object).

Little algorithms like this rotation can be derived using just TDD. First write the simplest thing that could possibly
work: copy each block individually to its rotated position (~9 lines of code). Then remove duplication to produce a
generic algorithm (~1 line of code).
