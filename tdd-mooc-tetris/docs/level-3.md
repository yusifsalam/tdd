# Level 3: Rotating tetrominoes

> Previously we figured out a way to rotate 3Ã—3 and 5Ã—5 block shapes. Now with the help of that, it should be easier to
> implement rotating tetrominoes.

Open the [test/RotatingTetrominoes.test.mjs](../test/RotatingTetrominoes.test.mjs) file and implement its tests one by
one.

The `Tetromino` class is meant to be [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object).

There are tests only for the T, I and O [tetrominoes](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetromino), because that's enough
to drive the implementation. You may test the rest of the tetrominoes yourself if you want, but it's also okay to trust
that the code works and the different shapes are declarative configuration.
