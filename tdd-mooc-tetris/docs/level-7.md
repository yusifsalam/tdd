# Level 7: Rotation system change

> Did you know that Tetris has many different [rotation systems](https://tetris.wiki/Category:Rotation_systems)? This
> far we have used an informally-specified, ad hoc system. Let's change it to a well known rotation system.

Change the tetrominoes to use the [Arika Rotation System](https://tetris.wiki/Arika_Rotation_System), which is used for
example in the _Tetris: The Grand Master_ series:

The design of our old `RotatingShape` doesn't anymore fit these new needs, because the T, L and J shapes no more rotate
around a single point. A better design could be to just hard-code the different orientations. That should also allow
removing quite much production and test code - [code is a liability](https://wiki.c2.com/?SoftwareAsLiability).

Some unrelated tests might break as a result of this change. That means that the tests were coupled to the choice of a
rotation system. Think about how the tests could be designed differently, so that they would not be affected by this
change. Or at least do the migration in [small steps](https://tdd.mooc.fi/2-design#small-safe-steps), so that no more
than one test is broken at a time.

Some possible refactoring strategies:

* Use [test doubles](https://tdd.mooc.fi/3-challenges#test-doubles) instead of the official tetrominoes. For example the
  original [FallingBlocks.test.mjs](../test/FallingBlocks.test.mjs) does this and thus avoids being coupled to the
  rotation system.
* Use the [parallel change](https://tdd.mooc.fi/2-design#four-strategies) refactoring strategy and keep both the old and
  new classes side by side. Migrate the tests to use the new classes one test at a time.
* If there are tests which do a complex sequence of moving and rotating tetrominoes just to set up the board state in
  the beginning of a test, instead create operations which let you easily set the board's state. Who knows, maybe
  they'll be useful also in production code (e.g. to implement save states).
