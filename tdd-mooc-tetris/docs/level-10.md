# Level 10: Randomness

Sometimes random is [too random](https://dilbert.com/strip/2001-10-25). Games often want predictable randomness, which
brings us to
the [shuffle bag](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/shuffle-bags-making-random-feel-more-random--gamedev-1249)
algorithm:

1. Pick a range of values with the desired distribution
2. Put all these values into a bag
3. Shuffle the bag's contents
4. Pull the values out one by one until you reach the end
5. Once you reach the end, shuffle and start over

Implement a shuffle bag for randomizing the tetrominoes. Later it can be used to feed tetrominoes to the board in random
order.

When the tests cannot assume the exact order of the randomized values, you will need to
do [property-based testing](https://increment.com/testing/in-praise-of-property-based-testing/)
and assert generic invariants instead of specific examples. (You won't need a property-based testing library here.)
See the course material's discussion on [testing randomness](https://tdd.mooc.fi/3-challenges#randomness).

## ðŸ¥³ That's all, folks

Obviously the game is not yet complete, because the game loop and UI are missing. However, since testing the UI is much
harder than backend code, it's left outside this exercise. Go making more simple programs with TDD before tackling the
hard parts.
